# Configuration

OpenGateLLM requires configuring a configuration file. This defines models, dependencies, and settings parameters.

By default, the configuration file must be `./config.yml` file.

You can change the configuration file by setting the `CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

The configuration file has 3 sections:

- `models`: models configuration.
- `dependencies`: dependencies configuration.
- `settings`: settings configuration.

## Secrets

You can pass environment variables in configuration file with pattern `${ENV_VARIABLE_NAME}`. All environment variables will be loaded in the configuration file.

**Example**

```yaml
models:
  - name: my-language-model
    type: text-generation
    providers:
      - type: openai
        url: https://api.openai.com
        key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
        model_name: gpt-4o-mini
```
<br></br>

# All settings
Refer to the [configuration example file](../../../config.example.yml) for an example of configuration.

## Model
In the models section, you define a list of models. Each model is a set of API providers for that model. Users will access the models specified in
this section using their *name*. Load balancing is performed between the different providers of the requested model. All providers in a model must
serve the same type of model (text-generation or text-embeddings-inference, etc.). We recommend that all providers of a model serve exactly the same
model, otherwise users may receive responses of varying quality. For embedding models, the API verifies that all providers output vectors of the
same dimension. You can define the load balancing strategy between the model's providers. By default, it is random.

For more information to configure model providers, see the [ModelProvider section](#modelprovider).
