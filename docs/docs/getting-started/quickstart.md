# Quickstart

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose

## Run OpenGateLLM

Execute the following command to run OpenGateLLM as quickstart setup:
```bash
make quickstart
```

:::note
It will copy these three files if they don't already exist:
- `config.example.yml`      -> `config.yml`
- `.env.example`            -> `.env`
- `compose.example.yml`     -> `compose.yml`
:::

:::tip
Use `make help` to see all available commands.
:::

OpenGateLLM is running at its most basic version, with the following features:
- an api connected to our free model: `albert-testbed`
- an user interface
- user and roles management

|----------|-------------|
| API URL | http://localhost:8000   |
| Playground URL | http://localhost:8501 |
| Master user | master |
| Master user password | changeme |
| Master API key | changeme |
:::

You can test that the API is running with:

```bash 
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer changeme" \
-d '{"model": "albert-testbed", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}]}'
```

:::warning
`albert-testbed` is a gemma3 model, running on cpu. It is not meant for production use, only dev purposes.

### Create a first user

You can create a non-admin user with the following command:

```bash
make create-user
```
The default created user will be `my-first-user` and its password `changeme`. The script create a role with `admin` permissions and no limits on all models. You
can edit the role and limits after creation by using the API or the Playground UI (see [Roles and permissions](../../functionalities/iam/roles-permissions-rate-limitings.md)).

```bash
>>> Role:              my-first-role
>>> Role permissions:  admin
>>> Role limits:       
>>>                    albert-testbed → unlimited
>>> 
>>> Email:             my-first-user
>>> Password:          changeme

>>> API key:           sk-eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0LCJ0b2tlbl9pZCI6MzQsImV4cGlyZXMiOjE3NjU2MDk5NDZ9.f8kLnrWnyUvGvWvWHMH4UoOowtLkAbCgs09keQb2DfU
```

:::warning
If you add a new model, you will need to create a new role with the appropriate permissions and limits or update the existing role with the appropriate limits.
